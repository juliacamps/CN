Analysing the predictive power of the interactions between human tower crews on their future performance
==========

DESCRIPTION
-----------
 * I model the performing-together interactions bettween human tower crews as a complex network and analyse the "mentoring" effect of performing-together with "more experienced" crews in the evolution in performance of "less experienced" crews, as well as the competitive effect of performing with crews of similar experience.

 * This assignment project is aimed to build a model representing a real world 
   problem, using a complex network representation, and analyse it,
   in order to extract new knowledge from it.

DATASET
-------
 * The dataset shown in "data" folder, is a new dataset, which contains
   information about the activity of castellers during the last years.

Disclaimer: The information included in the dataset for reproducibility of the results belongs to "La Coordinadora de Colles Castelleres de Catalunya" and "Base de Dades de la Coordinadora de Colles Castelleres de Catalunya â€“ CollaJove Xiquets de Tarragona".
