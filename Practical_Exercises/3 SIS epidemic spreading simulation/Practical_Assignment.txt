 Exercise 3: SIS epidemic spreading simulation
 ---------------------------------------------

	Monte Carlo simulation of a SIS epidemic spreading process in complex networks. We are interested in the 
	calculation of the fraction of infected nodes ρ, in the stationary state, as a function of the infection rate 
	β (at least 51 values, Δβ=0.02), for several values of the recovery rate μ (e.g. 0.1, 0.5, 0.9). Try with 
	networks of several kinds (e.g. Erdös-Rényi, scale-free, real) and different sizes (at least 500 nodes), mean 
	degrees, exponents, etc.

	Optional part: for each of the Monte Carlo simulations, find the theoretical predictions given by the Microscopic 
	Markov Chain Approach.

	The delivery must include:

		Source code
		Networks used in Pajek format
		Result files
		Document with plots of the results, specifying the network and "all" the parameters of the simulations

	Monte Carlo simulations may take a long computing time, 	thus it is preferable to use compiled programming languages. 
	In general, and specially if you are using an interpreted language (e.g. python, Matlab, octave, R), 
	first try with small networks, reduced number of time steps and a few repetitions, before sending the definitive 
	long simulations.
